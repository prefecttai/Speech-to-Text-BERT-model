# Speech-to-Text-BERT-model

This is a Speech to Text using BERT. This project is using the Wav2Vec from Hugging Face's automated speech recognition model

Preparation: 
Convert any audio file of your preference for transcription into .wav format
The Wav2vec.py is a python file with the necessary code to run. On line 9 of the file, set the filepath to your .wav file
Be sure to make the necessary changes to the duration, start and end time of your file as this will affect the segmentation portion of process
