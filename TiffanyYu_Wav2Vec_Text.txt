 ALL AROUND THE WORLD THERE'S A HUGE DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT GAP IN MOST COUNTRIES THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES IS TWICE THAT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES OFTEN IT'S AS HIGH AS EIGHTY PER CENT THERE ARE OVER ABILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LIVING WITH A DISABILITY TO HAVE EIGHTY PERSEN OF US UNEMPLOYED THAT'S SO MUCH UNTAPITENTIAL AS SONG WITH TA PARALYZED ARMEN LIVING WITH A MENTAL HALTH DISABILITY WHOSE WORKED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND ENTERTAINMENT INTECT I KNOW THAT HAVING A DISABILITY DOESN'T BAR YOU FROM DOING GOOD WORK SO IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT THIS DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT GAP IS SO PERSISTENT IN THE UASS THE AMERICANS THE DISABILITIES ACT PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AN HIRING AND REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AND STUDIES SHOW THAT COMPANIES WHO PRIORITIZE DISABILITY INCLUSION ARE MORE PROFITABLE OVER ALL SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM RECRUITERS HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF MANAGERS THEY TEND TO THINK OF HIRING PEOPLE DISABILITIES AS A SOCIAL GOOD OR ASSUM THING THEY HAVE TO DO TO MEET A QUOTA BUT THEY SHOULD BE HIRING DISAPLE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF OUR STRENGTHS AND ALL OF THE VALUE AND INNOVATION WE CAN BRING HERE ARE THREE THINGS EVERY WORKPLACE CAN DO TO TRULY WELCOME PEOPLE AF DISABILITIES IT'S NOT COMPREHENSIVE BUT IT'S A START FIRST STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS OUR CULTURE TENDS TO TREAT DISABILITY AS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS A TRAC GETY OR A CHARITY CASE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ROOTED AND PITY THEY PREVENT US FROM BEING SEEN AS PURES AND EQUALS THESE ASSUMPTIONS LEAD TO A LOT OF AVOIDANCE PEOPLE ATEND TO NOT ASK US ABOUT OUR LIVES AND HOBBIES OUTSIDE OF WORK OR DON'T INVITE US TO CCOMPANY SOCIAL OUTINGS THERE' SO MUCH FEAR ABOUT SAYING THE WRONG THING THAT INSTEAD PEOPLE SAY NOTHING AT ALL THEY TREAT US AWLE PEO PLE LIKE WERE INVISIBLE WHEN ALL WE WANT IS TO BE SEEN AND HEARD AND ACCEPTED LIKE ANY ONE ELSE THESE ASSUMPTIONS ALSO MAKE PEOPLE JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO WITHOUT EVEN ASKING FOR ME A SUMING I CAN'T TYPE BECAUSE I CAN'T USE ONE OF MY ARMS OR ASSUMING A BLIND PERSON CAN'T BE AN ENGINEER WHEN TO SUCCEED AT WORK YOU NEED AVE PEOPLE WHO SEE YOUR FULL POTENTIAL BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT NOBODY WINTS SO PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW US INVITE US TO THINGS ASK US THE SAME KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU WOULD OFE ANY COLLEAGUE WHAT DREW YOU TO THIS WORK WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS WHAT A YOU HOPE TO DO FROM HERE AND LISTEN TO OUR ANSWERS BUT ALL SO RESPECT OUR BOUNDARIES IF THERE SOMETHING WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING LET YOU KNOW AT ANY TIME YOU FEEL UNSURE JUST ASK US PRIVATELY SO WE CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS YOU CAN EVEN START BY SAYING I'M STILL LEARNING HOW TO GET BETTER AT TALKING ABOUT DISABILITY SECOND RETHINK ACCESSIBILITY IN ACCOMMODATIONS STARTING NOW DISABILITY TAKES SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS IT CAN BE ABOUT SOME ONE SIGHT HEARING OR MOBILITY IT CAN BE EIGHTY IGHT EDESLEXIA OR CHRONIC PIN ABOUT SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF EMPLOYS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE ONES THAT ARE NOT APPARENT SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT RE PUPIL OF DISABILITIES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION THERE PROBABLY ARE AND THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WORK PLACES CREATE SPACES WITH DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IN MIND THAT WAY YOU'RE PAVING THE WAY FOR FUTURE EMPLOYES CLI NS AND CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM ACCOMMODATIONS TOO AT ONE OF MY FIRST JOBS AT IN VESTEN BANK THE COMPANY DID SOMETHING COOL WITHIN A MONTH OF STARTING I AND ALL OTHER NEWHIRES GOT AN ERGONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORK STATIONS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A PERSON THINKING ABOUT MY ACCESS NEEDS IN MOLDIL WAYS LIKE GETTING ON FOOT REST IN KEYBOARD RIST PAT WHICH A LOT OF COLLEAE 'S GOT TO ASKING IF I MIGHT BENEFIT FROM SPEECH TO TEXT TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE I TYPED WITH ONE HAND I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO FIND THESE LITTLE HACKS TO MAKE MY WORK ENVIRONMENT MORE COMFORTABLE BUT THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON OFFERED SO MANY OPTIONS PRO ACTIVELY IT MADE ME FEEL SO WELCOME WITHOUT MAKING ME FEEL LIKE MY NEEDS WERE SPECIAL IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF EVERY EMPLOYER COULD DO SOME VERSION OF THIS I MEAN WHY NOT BUT THEREARE ALSO MORE SIMPLE THINGS THAT CAN MAKE AN IMPACT LIKE WHAT ABOUT LISTING ACCESSIBILITY IN FORMATION IF YOUR HOSTING AN EVENT OR AUTOMATICALLY TURNING ON CAPTIONS FOR VIDIO MEETINGS ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS WHAT DO MY EMPLOYS NEED AN ORDER TO THRIVE IT STARTS WITH EQUIPPING PEOPLE WITH A VARIETY OF TOOLS THIRD EMBRACE EXIBILITY LIKE DISABLE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO DO OUR WHOLE LIVES PEOPLE WOAD DISIBILITIES HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR REMOTE WORK ENVIRONMENTS AND FLEXIBLE HOURS FOR DECADES NOW AND IT TOOK A PIADEMIC FOR THE WORLD TO REALIZE IT COULD HAPPEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS THING THAT SEEMS SO WILD HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I CAN THINK OF WHEN AN ACCOMMODATION O REPUPIL DISIBILITIES ANDIT UP IMPROVING LIFE OR SOCIETY AT LARGE AUDIO BOOKS CURB CUDS CLOTHES CAPTIONING EVEN ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSHES DISABILITY IS SO OFTEN THE ROOT OF INNOVATION SO AS WE GET BACK TO THE OFFICE LET'S REMEMBER THAT ALL OF US CAN THRIVE WITH FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE DISIBILITIES LET'S PROVIDE THE OPTION TO WORK REMOTELY AT THE HOURS WHEN WE CAN BE THE M OST PRODOCTIVE FROM WHEREVER WORKS BEST I MEANS SOME OF US DO GREAT WORKING FROM OUR BED AND REALLY LET'S HOLD UNTO THE OPENNESS THAT WE CAN WORK AROUND EVERYONE'S NEEDS LET'S KEEP FINDING WAYS TO EMBRACE FLEXIBILITY AS PART OF OUR COMPANY'S SCULTURE WE KNOW THAT COMPANIASY TO WORK HARDER ON HIRING US RETAINING US PROMOTING US PAYING US FAIRLY AND AMPLIFYING OUR EFFORTS TO DO THAT WE NEED TO STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS RETHINK ACCESSIBILITY AND EMBRACE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS WHAT WE'LL HELP CLOSE THE DISIBILITY EMPLOYMENT GAP
